# TickerQ Example Project

## Introduction

This is a short example into using the C# scheduling library [TickerQ](https://github.com/Arcenox-co/TickerQ), inspired by the Nick Chapsas video on YouTube([here](https://youtu.be/x0dfj95Cj0U?si=ShMVCUHZIhvFgYM5)).

The demo is adapted a little by me but roughly follows his approach. Full explanation and details can be found on my wiki site [here](https://imorital.co.uk/CSharp/Scheduling/Tickerq/), this is basically the accompanying code to that page.

## Build and Test

The example uses a minimal API structure and should be relatively simple to build.
