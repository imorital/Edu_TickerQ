# TickerQ Example Project

## Introduction

This is a short example into using the C# scheduling library [TickerQ](https://github.com/Arcenox-co/TickerQ), 
inspired by the [Nick Chapsas video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/x0dfj95Cj0U?si=ShMVCUHZIhvFgYM5).

The demo is adapted a little by me but roughly follows his approach. Full explanation and details can be found on 
[my wiki site](https://imorital.co.uk/CSharp/Scheduling/Tickerq/), this is basically the accompanying code to that page.

## Build and Test

The example uses a minimal API structure and should be relatively simple to build. A connection string to the database is required, 
and the database should be created using the provided SQL script in the `Database` folder. All this is briefly explained in the 
accompanying wiki documentation.
